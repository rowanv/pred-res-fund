=============

This repository includes code associated with my research funding predictions project. I explore the following research question: "What determines the levels of funding that an NSF or NASA-funded project receives?"

Files:


TextAnalytics1: Data Cleaning and initial model selection for the 2013 dataset.

TextAnalytics2: Cross-Validation and results for 2013.

TextAnalytics3: I previously looked at Research Projects for 2013. I repeat the analysis
for 2011 and 2012. I aim to determine whether the types of research most likely to receive higher levels of funding changes over the years.
